# Hackintosh | Dell Optiplex 5060

If you don't know what a Hackintosh is, this repository is not for you.

This repository is the OpenCore EFI folder for Dell Optiplex 5060 SFF. I've dual booted by Dell CPU to run both Windows11 and macOS 12. This repository will be updated with more details soon.
